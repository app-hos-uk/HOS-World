# Railway Configuration for Notification Microservice
# This service is created in Railway as a separate service in the same project.
#
# Railway setup:
#   1. In your Railway project, click "New Service" > "GitHub Repo"
#   2. Select this repo, then set:
#      - Root Directory: (leave empty -- Dockerfile uses repo root as context)
#      - Dockerfile Path: services/notification/Dockerfile
#   3. Set environment variables (see below)
#   4. The service shares the same PostgreSQL and Redis instances as the monolith
#

#   DATABASE_URL         - Same PostgreSQL connection string as the monolith
#   REDIS_URL            - Same Redis connection string as the monolith
#   JWT_SECRET           - Same secret as the monolith API
#   NOTIFICATION_PORT    - 3003 (or use Railway's PORT variable)
#
# Optional environment variables:
#   SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_FROM  - Email config
#   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER - WhatsApp config
