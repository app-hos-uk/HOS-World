# Railway Configuration for API Gateway
# This service is created in Railway as a separate service in the same project.
#
# Railway setup:
#   1. In your Railway project, click "New Service" > "GitHub Repo"
#   2. Select this repo, then set:
#      - Root Directory: (leave empty -- Dockerfile uses repo root as context)
#      - Dockerfile Path: services/gateway/Dockerfile
#   3. Set environment variables (see below)
#
# Required environment variables (set in Railway dashboard):
#   JWT_SECRET           - Same secret as the monolith API
#   MONOLITH_API_URL     - Private Railway URL of the monolith (e.g., http://api.railway.internal:3001)
#   NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL - Private Railway URL of notification service (e.g., http://notification.railway.internal:3003)
#   GATEWAY_PORT         - 4000 (or use Railway's PORT variable)
