# Quick Start Guide - Development Server

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/sabuj/Desktop/HOS-latest Sabu"
```

**Important:** Always start from the root directory of the project, not from `apps/web`.

### 2. Check if Port 3000 is Available

If you get a "port already in use" error, kill any existing processes:

```bash
# Kill any process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

You have two options:

#### Option A: Using the Startup Script (Recommended)

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

#### Option B: Manual Start

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev --workspace=apps/web
```

Or if you prefer to navigate to the web app:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access the Application

Once the server starts, open your browser and navigate to:

**http://localhost:3000**

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "EPERM: operation not permitted"

This means port 3000 is already in use or you don't have permission. Try:

1. Kill existing processes:
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. Use a different port:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   PORT=3001 npm run dev
   ```
   Then access: http://localhost:3001

### Error: "react not found"

This means dependencies aren't installed. Run:

```bash
# From the root directory
npm install
```

### Error: "Cannot find module"

Make sure workspace packages are built:

```bash
# From the root directory
cd packages/shared-types && npm run build && cd ../..
cd packages/theme-system && npm run build && cd ../..
cd packages/utils && npm run build && cd ../..
cd packages/api-client && npm run build && cd ../..
```

### Server Starts But Page Doesn't Load

1. Check the terminal for compilation errors
2. Open browser developer console (F12) and check for errors
3. Try clearing the Next.js cache:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

## Common Issues

- **Wrong directory**: Always start from the project root (`/Users/sabuj/Desktop/HOS-latest Sabu`)
- **Port in use**: Kill existing processes or use a different port
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm install` from the root directory
- **Workspace packages not built**: Build them as shown above
