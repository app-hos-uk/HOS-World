## 🎯 Method 2: Railway CLI with Database Connection

If you have Railway CLI and can connect to the database:

```bash
# Make sure you're linked to the Railway project
cd services/api
railway link

# Connect to database
railway connect postgres

# In a NEW terminal, run:
cd services/api
cat ../scripts/create-team-role-users.sql | railway run psql
```

## 🎯 Method 3: Prisma Studio (Visual)

### Step 1: Open Prisma Studio on Railway

```bash
cd services/api
railway run pnpm db:studio
```

Prisma Studio will open in your browser.

### Step 2: Create Users Manually

For each user:

1. Click **"User"** model
2. Click **"Add record"** (+)
3. Fill in:
   - **email:** (from table below)

## 📋 Users to Create

| Email | Role | First Name | Last Name | Password Hash |
|-------|------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| admin@hos.test | ADMIN | Admin | User | `$2b$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy` |

**Password for all:** `Test123!`

## ✅ Verification

After creating users, verify they exist:

**Via SQL Query (in Railway Database interface):**
```sql
SELECT email, role, "firstName", "lastName", "createdAt"
FROM users
WHERE email LIKE '%@hos.test'
ORDER BY role;
```

**Or test login via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://hos-marketplaceapi-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@hos.test", "password": "Test123!"}'
```

Should return a JWT token with `"role": "ADMIN"`.

1. Railway Dashboard → PostgreSQL → Data/Query tab
2. Copy contents of `scripts/create-team-role-users.sql`
3. Paste and execute
