# Cursor IDE Image Upload Information

## Current Limitation

The Cursor IDE chat interface does not currently support direct image uploads through the chat window. This is a limitation of the chat interface itself, not something that can be fixed through code changes.

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Describe the Image
- Describe the image content, error messages, or UI elements in text
- Provide file paths or code snippets that relate to the image
- I can read files directly from your workspace using the file reading tools

### Option 2: Use File Paths
- If the image is in your workspace, I can read it using file paths
- Example: "Check the image at `apps/web/public/logo.png`"
- I can analyze image files if they're in the workspace

### Option 3: Paste Image URLs
- If the image is hosted online, provide the URL
- I can access public URLs through web search tools

### Option 4: Use Terminal/Code Descriptions
- For screenshots of errors: copy the error text instead
- For UI mockups: describe the layout and components
- For diagrams: describe the structure or provide the source code

## What I Can Help With

✅ Reading and analyzing code files  
✅ Reading text-based files (markdown, JSON, etc.)  
✅ Analyzing file structures and project organization  
✅ Debugging based on error messages and code  
✅ Creating and modifying code files  
✅ Running terminal commands  
✅ Searching the codebase  

## Future Improvements

If Cursor IDE adds image upload support in future updates, we'll be able to:
- Analyze screenshots directly
- Review UI mockups visually
- Debug visual issues more effectively

For now, text descriptions work well for most development tasks!
