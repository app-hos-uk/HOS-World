# ✅ Phase 1 Testing - Ready for Execution

## 🎯 Status

**All testing infrastructure is ready!** The API server is running successfully, and all test scripts are prepared.

---

## 📋 What's Ready

### ✅ Test Scripts
- `test-phase1-curl.sh` - Automated curl-based API tests
- `test-phase1-e2e.sh` - Full E2E test suite
- Playwright tests in `apps/web/e2e/`

### ✅ Documentation
- `PHASE_1_TESTING_EXECUTION.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `QUICK_TEST_COMMANDS.md` - Quick reference for test commands
- `PHASE_1_E2E_TEST_PLAN.md` - Detailed test plan

### ✅ API Server
- ✅ Running on `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ All routes registered
- ✅ Versioning enabled (v1 + legacy)
- ✅ Swagger docs available at `/api/docs`

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Option 1: Automated Curl Tests (Recommended First)

**In a new terminal** (while API server is running):

```bash
cd "/Users/apple/Desktop/HOS-latest Sabu"
./test-phase1-curl.sh
```

This will test:
- ✅ API health check
- ✅ API versioning (v1 + legacy)
- ✅ Promotions endpoints
- ✅ Shipping endpoints
- ✅ Swagger documentation

**Expected Output**: Color-coded test results with pass/fail counts

---

### Option 2: Manual Endpoint Testing

**Test individual endpoints**:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health

# Versioning
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/products?page=1&limit=1
curl http://localhost:3001/api/products?page=1&limit=1

# Promotions
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/promotions

# Shipping
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/shipping/methods
```

See `QUICK_TEST_COMMANDS.md` for more examples.

---

### Option 3: Playwright Browser Tests

**Requires both API and Frontend servers**:

```bash
# Terminal 1: API (already running)
# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd apps/web
pnpm dev

# Terminal 3: Run tests
cd apps/web
pnpm test:e2e
```

## 🧪 Test Execution Plan

### Step 1: Run Automated API Tests (5 minutes)

```bash
./test-phase1-curl.sh
```

**What it tests**:
- Public endpoints (no auth required)
- API versioning
- Basic endpoint accessibility

**Expected**: Most tests should pass (some may be skipped if auth required)

---

### Step 2: Test with Authentication (10 minutes)

**Get an admin token**:

```bash
# Create test users first (if not already created)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/create-team-users

# Login as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"`$TEST_SEED_PASSWORD` (env)"}'
```

**Save the token**, then test protected endpoints:

```bash
# Create a promotion
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/promotions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Promotion",
    "type": "PERCENTAGE",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "startDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
    "discountType": "PERCENTAGE",
    "discountValue": 10
  }'
```

See `PHASE_1_TESTING_EXECUTION.md` for detailed authenticated test scenarios.

---

### Step 3: Frontend Integration Tests (15 minutes)

**If frontend is running**:

1. **Cart Page**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/cart`
   - Test coupon application
   - Verify discount calculation

2. **Checkout Page**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/checkout`
   - Test shipping method selection
   - Verify shipping cost calculation

3. **Payment Page**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/payment?orderId=ORDER_ID`
   - Test payment provider selection
   - Verify gift card application

---

### Step 4: Playwright E2E Tests (20 minutes)

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm test:e2e
```

**What it tests**:
- Complete user flows
- UI interactions
- Error handling
- Responsive design

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Connection refused" when running tests

**Solution**: Ensure API server is running:
```bash
cd services/api
pnpm dev
```

Wait for: `✅ Server is listening on port 3001`

---

### Issue: Tests return 401 (Unauthorized)

**Solution**: This is expected for protected endpoints. Either:
1. Use authentication tokens (see Step 2 above)
2. Tests will be marked as "SKIPPED" in automated scripts

---

### Issue: Frontend tests fail

**Solution**: 
1. Ensure both servers are running
2. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set to `http://localhost:3001/api`
3. Verify CORS is configured in API

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Phase 1 testing is complete when:

1. ✅ All public API endpoints return expected responses
2. ✅ Versioning works (v1 + legacy endpoints)
3. ✅ Promotions can be created and applied (with auth)
4. ✅ Shipping rules can be configured (with auth)
5. ✅ Frontend pages integrate correctly
6. ✅ E2E tests pass (or have acceptable failures)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

1. **Document Results**: Record test outcomes
2. **Fix Critical Bugs**: Address any blocking issues
3. **Update Documentation**: Update API docs if needed
4. **Performance Testing**: Run load tests (Phase 1-6)
5. **Proceed to Phase 2**: Move to next features
