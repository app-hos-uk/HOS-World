curl -X GET https://hos-marketplaceapi-production.up.railway.app/api/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Admin Capabilities

With `ADMIN` role, you can:

- ✅ Manage products, orders, sellers
- ✅ View analytics and reports

## 🔒 Security Recommendations

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Change Password

The default password ``$SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (env)` is **not secure** for production:

1. **Login immediately** using the credentials above
2. **Change password** to a strong password:
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Not easily guessable
3. **Enable 2FA** if available
4. **Use password manager** for secure storage

### Password Change (if endpoint available):
```bash
curl -X POST https://hos-marketplaceapi-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/change-password \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currentPassword": "`$SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (env)",
    "newPassword": "YourNewStrongPassword123!"
  }'
```

## 🆘 If Login Still Fails

1. **Check API Logs:**
   - Railway Dashboard → API service → Logs
   - Look for authentication errors

2. **Verify Database:**
   - Check that `role` = `ADMIN`
   - Check that `password` starts with `$2b$10$`
   - Check that `email` = `app@houseofspells.co.uk`

3. **Restart API Service:**
   - Sometimes a restart is needed after database changes

4. **Wait a Few Seconds:**
   - Database changes might need a moment to propagate
