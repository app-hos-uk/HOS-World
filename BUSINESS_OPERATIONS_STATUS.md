  - PROCUREMENT_REJECTED (1)
- 1 fulfillment center
- 1 shipment (PENDING status)
- 1 catalog entry
- 1 marketing material

**How to Run:**

**Option 1: Via Railway CLI**
```bash
cd services/api
railway run pnpm ts-node ../../scripts/seed-sample-business-data.ts
```

**Option 2: Create API Endpoint** (Recommended)
Create an admin endpoint to trigger seeding:
```typescript
// In admin controller
@Post('seed-sample-data')
async seedSampleData() {
  // Import and run seed function
}
```

**Option 3: Direct Database Access**
- Use Prisma Studio: `railway run pnpm db:studio`
