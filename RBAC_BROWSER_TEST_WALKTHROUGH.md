# 🔐 RBAC Browser Test Walkthrough - Step by Step

## ✅ Mock Users Created Successfully!

I've successfully created 3 test users via API:

1. ✅ **CUSTOMER** - `customer@hos.test` / ``$TEST_SEED_PASSWORD` (env)`
2. ✅ **WHOLESALER** - `wholesaler@hos.test` / ``$TEST_SEED_PASSWORD` (env)`
3. ✅ **B2C_SELLER** - `seller@hos.test` / ``$TEST_SEED_PASSWORD` (env)`

**Note:** Team roles (ADMIN, PROCUREMENT, etc.) need to be created manually via Prisma Studio or SQL.
