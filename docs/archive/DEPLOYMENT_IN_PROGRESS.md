## ✅ After Deployment Completes

### Step 1: Verify Deployment Status

**In Railway Dashboard:**
- Deployment status should be: **"Active"** or **"Ready"**
- Service should be running
- No error messages in logs

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache

**Important:** Clear your browser cache to get the new build:

**Option A: Hard Refresh**
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Option B: Incognito/Private Window**
- Open a new incognito/private window
- Test login there (no cache)

**Option C: Clear Cache Completely**
- Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Clear data

### Step 3: Test Frontend Login

1. **Go to:** `https://hos-marketplaceweb-production.up.railway.app/login`

2. **Open DevTools:**
   - Press F12
   - Go to **Console** tab
   - Go to **Network** tab

3. **Try to Login:**
   - Email: `app@houseofspells.co.uk`
   - Password: ``$SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (env)`
   - Click "Login"

4. **Check Console:**
   - ✅ Should see requests to: `https://hos-marketplaceapi-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login`
   - ❌ Should NOT see: `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login`
   - ❌ Should NOT see: CORS errors

5. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Look for `login` request
   - Status should be `200 OK` (not CORS error or 404)
   - Request URL should be Railway API URL

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ No CORS errors in console
- ✅ API calls go to Railway URL (not localhost)
- ✅ Login works successfully
- ✅ Redirects to dashboard
- ✅ Token received and saved

### If Still Seeing Localhost:
- ⚠️ Build might not have picked up the variable
- ⚠️ Browser cache might be serving old code
- ⚠️ Try incognito window or clear cache completely
